# Movie Classification and Sentiment Analysis

This project explores movie data from Rotten Tomatoes, performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews and classifying movies based on various features. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Movie Classification**: Using a Random Forest Classifier to predict the tomatometer status of movies based on features such as runtime, ratings, and content rating.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face Transformers to analyze critic reviews and predict the overall sentiment of a movie.
